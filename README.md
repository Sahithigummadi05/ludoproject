# ludoproject
This project is a console-based implementation of the popular board game Ludo, written in C programming language. The game allows players to experience the classic fun of Ludo, following the traditional rules and gameplay mechanics.

Features
	•	Turn-based gameplay for multiple players.
	•	Simple, interactive console-based interface.
	•	Implementation of core Ludo rules, such as dice rolls, token movement, and winning conditions.
	•	Robust logic to manage player turns and handle edge cases.

Purpose:
This project demonstrates the application of fundamental programming concepts in C, such as:
	•	Data structures: Arrays and structures to manage the game board and player tokens.
	•	Control flow: Loops and conditional statements for game logic.
	•	Functions: Modular approach to implement various components of the game.
	•	Random number generation: Simulating dice rolls using the rand() function.
 
 This project not only provides an engaging way to play Ludo but also serves as a stepping stone for exploring more complex game development and software projects. Whether you’re a beginner learning C or an enthusiast revisiting the joy of classic games, this project offers a fun and educational experience.

 Thank you for exploring this project!
